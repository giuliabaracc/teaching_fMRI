# teaching_fMRI
Materials for teaching fMRI tailored to novices (with background in neuroscience and coding).

05/2024: Originally prepared these for a class I taught in the Masters program at USyd.

07/2024: Tweaked these for the ISMRM ANZ fMRI Workshop.

Data used to generate the tutorial are openly available [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005270/versions/1.0.0) (data used for fMRIprep) and [here](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) (data used for analyses).
